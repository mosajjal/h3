# Allwinner H3 Files
Allwinner H3 Kernel, U-boot and instructions.

# Included
A working kernel (3.4.112) with /lib/modules directory (drivers) included.

A working mainline (4.9rc1) with Systemd support and /lib/modules directory included. Almost everything works with this kernel, including Ethernet, HDMI, USB, OTG, etc. Although I got "out of range" error while testing it with OPI-PC and Nano Pi M1. 
Feedbacks are welcome.

A working U-boot (Tested on Orange pi PC and Nano Pi M1)
